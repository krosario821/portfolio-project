          Hi, my name is Kailey Rosario. As a student of computer science, I'm
          now learning more about digital content and web development. I've had
          a GitHub account for a while, but I'm getting better at using it to
          share my work and collaborate with others. I like solving problems,
          creating meaningful efforts, and always picking up new skills in
          technology.
        </p>

        <h3>Skills & Interests:</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Programming Languages:</strong> C++, currently learning Java
          </li>
          <li><strong>Design Tools:</strong> A little bit of Canva</li>
          <li><strong>Technologies & Tools:</strong> Currently using GitHub</li>
          <li>
            <strong>Other Interests:</strong> Taekwondo, cooking, dancing,
            loving kids/children, loving animals
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Career Goals</h3>
        <p>
          Right now, I'm focusing on enhancing my GitHub workflow and expanding
          my portfolio. My objectives are to design real-world projects, obtain
          practical experience through internships, and advance as a developer.

          I’m Kailey Rosario, a passionate and determined computer science student who loves combining creativity with technology. 
          Growing up as a first-generation Hispanic American from an immigrant family, I’ve learned to value resilience, hard work, and the importance of family. 
          When I’m not coding or exploring digital content, you can find me practicing Taekwondo, spending time with kids and animals, or dancing around the house!
