      <p>
        Hi! I'm <strong>Kailey Rosario</strong>, a passionate computer science student who loves blending creativity with technology. As a first-generation Hispanic American raised by immigrant parents, I carry a deep pride in my heritage and the resilience it's instilled in me.
      </p>
      <p>
        I'm currently working toward my Associate’s in Computer Science while building a portfolio that showcases my interests in digital content, web design, and programming. My goal is to use technology as a tool to inspire and uplift others—especially women and minorities in tech.
      </p>
      <p>
        Since 2021, I’ve also been training in <strong>Taekwondo</strong>, which has taught me discipline, perseverance, and the importance of mental strength. It’s more than a sport to me—it's part of my journey toward personal growth.
      </p>
      <p>
        When I’m not coding or kicking, you’ll likely find me spending time with <strong>kids and animals</strong>, dancing around the house, journaling, or listening to music. I value honesty, joy, and creativity in everything I do.
      </p>
      <p>
        Long-term, I hope to blend my love for technology with my traditional values. My dream is to build meaningful software, raise a big, loving family, and live a life rooted in connection, purpose, and faith.
